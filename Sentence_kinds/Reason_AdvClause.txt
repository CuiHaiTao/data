As all the seats were full,he stood up.
As it was raining,I stayed at home.
As we've no money,we can't buy it.
He could not have seen me,for I was not there.
He distrusted me because I was new.
I can't get to sleep because of the noise outside.
I didn't go because I was afraid.
I do it because I like it.
I study hard because I want to be a college student in the future.
Now that you are here, you'd better stay.
Now that you are well again,you can travel.
Seeing that it's raining, we'd betterstay indoors.
Since we've no money, we can't buy it.
Since you're not interested,I won't tell you about it.
The country is not strong because it is large.
The sweater shrank because it was washed badly.
The woolly shrank because it was washed badly.
We went by bus because it was cheaper.
You can trust those products because the quality never varies.
You shouldn't get angry just because some people speak ill of you.
